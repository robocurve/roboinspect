"""RoboLens error taxonomy.

The split below resolves the "fail fast vs never-crash-overnight" tension:

- [`ConfigError`][robolens.errors.ConfigError] /
[`CompatibilityError`][robolens.errors.CompatibilityError] are raised *before* any
  rollout — bad configuration should fail loudly and immediately.
- [`PolicyError`][robolens.errors.PolicyError] is recorded as a failed trial; whether it aborts the
eval
  is governed by ``fail_on_error`` (Inspect semantics).
- [`EmbodimentFault`][robolens.errors.EmbodimentFault] and
[`SafetyAbort`][robolens.errors.SafetyAbort] *always* halt the eval
  regardless of ``fail_on_error`` — a faulted or unsafe robot must never
  auto-advance to the next scene unattended.
