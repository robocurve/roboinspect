"""The rollout engine — the closed control loop at the heart of RoboLens.

One [`rollout`][robolens.rollout.rollout] runs a single trial (one scene, one epoch): it drives the
policy↔embodiment loop through the [`Controller`][robolens.controller.Controller]
(open-loop chunk execution) and the [`Approver`][robolens.approver.Approver] safety
gate, logging each step to the sinks, and returns an immutable
[`TrialRecord`][robolens.rollout.TrialRecord] that scorers consume.
