"""The rollout engine — the closed control loop at the heart of RoboLens.

One :func:`rollout` runs a single trial (one scene, one epoch): it drives the
policy↔embodiment loop through the :class:`~robolens.controller.Controller`
(open-loop chunk execution) and the :class:`~robolens.approver.Approver` safety
gate, logging each step to the sinks, and returns an immutable
:class:`TrialRecord` that scorers consume.
