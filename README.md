# RoboLens

**The [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/) for robotics** — an open-source
evaluation framework for **physical AI** and **VLA (vision-language-action)
models**.

Define a robotics benchmark once, then run *any* VLA policy against *any*
compatible embodiment — a real robot or a simulator — with reproducible logs and
first-class [Rerun](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun) visualization.

> ⚠️ **Status: early alpha.** APIs are unstable and may change on any release
> before `1.0`. This repository is the *framework*. Concrete benchmarks (the
> "Inspect Evals for robotics") live in a separate repository.

## Why RoboLens

LLM evals have one swappable input: the model. **Robotics evals have two** — the
**policy** (the VLA "brain") and the **embodiment** (the robot/sim "body and
world"). RoboLens makes both first-class and orthogonal:

- **`Policy`** — a VLA that maps observations + a language instruction to an
  *action chunk* (a horizon of actions executed open-loop, as π0 / ACT /
  diffusion policies do).
- **`Embodiment`** — a real robot or simulator that produces observations,
  executes actions, and owns the action/observation spaces and control rate.
- **`Task`** — an embodiment-agnostic benchmark: a dataset of `Scene`s (initial
  conditions / instructions / success targets) plus scorers.

Before any rollout, RoboLens checks that a `(policy, embodiment)` pair is
*compatible* (action/observation spaces, semantics, camera/state key mapping,
control rate) and fails fast and loud if not.

## Design principles

- **Real-world first.** The interfaces assume real-robot reality (human-in-the-loop
  reset, no privileged success oracle, wall-clock control rate); simulators are a
  stricter special case that may offer more.
- **Reproducible logs.** Every run produces an immutable, schema-versioned
  `EvalLog` recording the resolved config, git revision, package versions, and
  per-scene results — re-scorable offline.
- **Light core, optional everything.** The core depends only on NumPy and the
  standard library. Rerun and simulator/VLA backends are optional extras and
  separately installable plugins.
- **Safe unattended runs.** An explicit error taxonomy separates "record the
  failure and continue" from "halt the eval and require a human", so a faulted
  robot never auto-advances overnight.

## Install

```bash
pip install robolens            # core (numpy only)
pip install "robolens[rerun]"   # + Rerun visualization
```

Development setup uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
uv run pytest
```

## Quickstart

No hardware or simulator needed — the `CubePick` mock world exercises the whole
stack:

```python
from robolens import eval
from robolens.mock import CubePickEmbodiment, ScriptedPolicy
from robolens.scene import Scene
from robolens.scorer import success_at_end
from robolens.task import Task

task = Task(
    name="cubepick-reach",
    scenes=[Scene(id=f"layout-{i}", instruction="reach the cube", init_seed=i) for i in range(5)],
    scorer=success_at_end(),
    max_steps=80,
)

# The two swappable inputs: a policy (VLA) and an embodiment (robot/sim).
(log,) = eval(task, ScriptedPolicy(), CubePickEmbodiment())
print(log.status, log.results.metrics)   # success {'success_at_end': 1.0}
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
robolens list                                   # show registered components
robolens run --task cubepick-reach --policy scripted --embodiment cubepick
```

See [`examples/quickstart.py`](examples/quickstart.py) for a fuller example
(multiple scorers, epochs, reducers).

## Extending RoboLens

Backends ship as separate **plugin packages** that register components through
entry points (`robolens.policies`, `robolens.embodiments`, `robolens.tasks`,
`robolens.scorers`, `robolens.sinks`) — they then appear in `robolens list` and
resolve by name. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Status & roadmap

See [`plans/`](plans/) for the design documents. The foundation is being built as
a vertical tracer (one scene → chunked rollout → score → log) that is then
thickened layer by layer.
